# To-Do List Application

In this project I had to design and creat a To-Do List Application, where the user has access to a website and perform CRUD actions on Lists and on a set of Tasks assigned to those lists.

### Prerequisites

You need the latest version of Eclipse, Apache Maven and SpringBoot for the backend; Chrome, Visual Studio Code and Selenium for the frontend.

Fork Repository from my github (https://github.com/nikolettbajna/TDL) to your repository, then
clone it to your computer, open Eclipse and Import file As exsisting Maven project. Open Visual Studio Code then File -> Open Folder then in the project forlder go to src -> main -> resources -> static and open up the 'ToDoWeb' folder.

##Running the project

Using Eclipse tun the project as Spring Boot App then open up your Chrome and type in https://localhost:5500/index.html to rech the website or using Visual Studio Code open up the index.html file then click on 'Go live' and the website will be opened up for you.

## Running the tests

Right click on the name of the project (TDL) -> Coverage as -> JUnit Test
The Coverage tab shows the coverage, while you can go into more details using the JUnit tab.
